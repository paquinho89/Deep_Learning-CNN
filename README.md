# Guitar or not Guitar? (Convolutional Neural Network - Deep Learning)
Jan 2019 â€“ Feb 2019

Project descriptionThe purpose of this project is to go into what deep learning is and create a Convultional Neural Networks in order to create a model and recognize if a Guitar is present (or not) in a picture.

The project is divided in 4 main blocks:

1_Getting the necessary data to go ahaed with the model: This part is ignored in most of the tutorials, but it is one of the most difficult parts of any project. Usually, data scientiest which have just started work in this filed, have never faced the problems of getting the data. In real word the data is not clean and there is a lot of work to do before starting to build the model

2_Preparing the data

3_Creating the model:

4_Testing the performance of the model: Cofussion matrix, recal, accuracy, ROC cuurve...

NOTE: Due the the high computational resources that this Convultional Neural Network requires, I recommend run the code using google coolab
